## 📝 Project Description  
Welcome to the **gsg_level_3_codes** repository!  
This project contains my solution for the **Activity Schedules** assignment (Level 3) in GSG.  

The goal of this assignment is to generate all valid sequences of daily activities over _n_ days,  
using the activities:  
🏊‍♂️ Swimming, 🏃‍♀️ Running, and ⚽ Football,  
with the constraint that no two consecutive days have the same activity.

Feel free to explore the code and run the solution!  
If you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out. 😊
